**AI:** "Here's some content for 'Chapter 3: The Confrontation':

The air between them crackled with tension. Sarah's hands trembled as she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. 'You knew,' she said, each word sharp as a blade. 'You knew what would happen, and you did nothing.'

Marcus shifted uncomfortably, avoiding her gaze. 'I tried to warn you,' he muttered, but his words sounded hollow even to his own ears.

'Tried?' Sarah's laugh was bitter, cutting through the silence like broken glass. 'You didn't try hard enough. People died because of your silence.'

Would you like me to continue from here, or would you prefer a different approach?"
